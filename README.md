# Assignment 1: Chest X-ray Pneumonia Classification

## Instructions:
I have written my code in Google Colab Python notebook. (.ipynb)

### P1.ipynb: ResNet-18 Model
This code is my solution to Task 1.1. The *objective* of Task 1.1 is to employ an “off-the-shelf” CNN architecture for the 
classification of chest x-ray images for the presence of pneumonia. The model is to be trained from scratch.

### P2.ipynb: Transfer Learning. 
This code is my solution to Task 1.2. For this task, our goal is to leverage the pretrained ImageNet weights on the 
ResNet18. Specifically, the aim is to achieve the best test accuracy possible with 
these learned weights.
